Interview de Katie
------------------------

1) What group were you a part of, and/or what were their beliefs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was a part of two high control groups that were loosely/unofficially connected—one served as a little bit of a pipeline/recruitment area for the other, but both pulled families in and got them tangled up into a bunch of groupthink and rules. One was a homeschool group that was local only, and one was the global religious group Opus Dei. Both groups followed a stricter/traditionalist interpretation of doctrine and what correct behavior should be. They believed that all Church doctrine outlined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church is true, and that many members of the Catholic Church today are not actually faithful Catholics, and it's really only a subset of Catholics that are true anymore. We truly practicing Catholics needed to keep our faith strong and bring home strayed Catholics, lapsed Catholics, and any other people we could draw in to the Church through our friendship and example. The Church had been under attack for decades by forces of evil both within and without. There was corruption and discord, and it's the role of all faithful Catholics to return to the older traditions and views of morality that held society together in previous eras. Very conservative and traditionalist views were the norm, and there was a lot of quiet disagreement with a lot of the "liberalization" of the Catholic Church since Vatican II back in the 1960s. There was a general sense of being persecuted for our strong moral faith, and a drive to fight the secular culture we lived in (in the hopes of returning it to traditional morality and family values). And of course there was all the usual good parts too, like close communities, group and individual support, learning opportunities, enjoyable times with good people, genuine charity and empathy, community support work, being a part of something bigger than ourselves--all the stuff that makes it feel good and helpful to be spiritual and connected and part of a cohesive group.

2) Was there a guru? If so, how did it articulate around them?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the homeschool co-op, no. But in Opus Dei, yes. It was founded by a man named Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás. Everybody calls him Saint Josemaria these days. He was canonized as a Catholic Saint not super long after he died.

Opus Dei was the direct creation of Josemaria. He built it from the ground up and ran it personally pretty much his whole life. He got the group connected with Pope Saint John Paul II and eventually got the group named a "personal prelature" of the Church and given special status. For the decades that followed, Saint Josemaria ran Opus Dei and drove its recruitment, growth, and expansion efforts until he literally couldn't anymore, and the whole organization is devoted to him and The Way that he created for them to follow. Opus Dei members definitely revere him.
Oh good!

3) Do you know how the group was created?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not sure how the homeschool group was created, but it was sometime a couple decades ago.
Opus Dei was founded around the time of Spain's unrest and Civil War in the early 20th century. It did pretty well in Franco's spain and had a lot of growth there and around the world in the following decades. Saint Josemaria believed God sent him the ideas and plans for Opus Dei and The Work, and he worked to gain followers and spread his way of practicing Catholic spirituality around the world.

4) How did you first join, if you made that decision?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When I graduated fifth grade, I was invited to a Summer Camp from our local women-and-girls Opus Dei center by the daughter of someone my parents had known for years. Their family had kids that were my older siblings' age, and my parents trusted their parents. They had a daughter my age, and that daughter and her mom told my mom and me about this one-week-long summer camp that was super safe and fun and Catholic and run by Opus Dei, and had both summer camp activities and spiritual formation. I was interested, and even though my mom was nervous about me sleeping away at the camp, she let me go.
I had a really good time my first year as a camper, and when my parents picked me up that Saturday, I told them I already wanted to go back the next year. They said maybe, we'll see. But the next year, I definitely did.
The same girl was given a flyer/paper to mail me about the middle school girls' group that met regularly at the women-and-girls local Opus Dei center, and she sent along a little note inviting me to come with her.
I did. She and I went to pretty much every event the local center put on for middle school girls over the next few years, and then for high school girls as well. Lots of afternoons, evenings, and weekends of reflection, with Benedictions, priest-led meditations, and lots of virtue and morality talks, plus some service projects sometimes. Summer camp each summer as either a camper or a counselor. Special overnights for particular prayer initiatives. Trainings on household skills and baking. A pool party once or twice, just lots of different things to get us all together and involved. I kept going back for a lot of years after that first summer.

5) What was life in this group like, how was the daily routine etc?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I can't say what life is like exactly for the full members of Opus Dei, because only the people who live in their centers know for sure. But the daily rules I was supposed to follow to be good/holy were the same for both the homeschool co-op and Opus Dei.
I was supposed to be praying often--constantly, if possible. That's something you learn from Saint Josemaria's writings and teachings. You're supposed to train yourself over time to make it so you're consciously and subconsciously living your whole life in a state of prayer no matter what you're doing all day. But regardless of that part, I definitely was supposed to do serious prayer and some scripture reading or Mass attendance every day. I had to receive the Eucharist at Mass at least once a week on Sundays, but preferrably daily if I could manage it.
I was encouraged to practice daily sacrifice or self-mortification, offering up suffering or choosing to not have something I wanted or to be physically uncomfortable and dedicate it to a particular cause like the suffering souls in Purgatory. It was part of my training in cheerful service.
I wasn't supposed to do any activites or wear any makeup or accessories that would call attention to myself in immodest ways, or to show off my figure too clearly. Every morning, or whenever else I changed outfits, they had to go through modesty checks from me/my parents/camp counselors/Opus Dei members/co-op parents/whatever. Anything that broke the list of rules had to go back in the closet or in the trash. It would be too dangerous and immoral to tempt boys, men, priests, and other males around me, so all the adults made sure we followed the rules, front, back, squatting to check fit, etc.

6) What were the consequences of you being in this cult/high control group ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While I was in it, it felt like I was in a constant state of war between what felt healthy but wasn't supposed to be something I wanted and what felt horrible but was what I was told was the real and good truth. I couldn't survive that without learning to silence and smash down my instincts and intuition. I also had a really hard time accessing or accepting a lot of my emotions, because so many of them weren't allowed in the groups I lived with and socialized in. So I ended up feeling constantly like I was a fake liar and must just be a horrible person for struggling so much on the inside when everyone else seemed to be just fine.
I also was constantly torn between the way I wanted to view and treat people I encountered in life and the way that the people I trusted taught me I should view and treat those people. When so much in my life didn't add up or make sense, it inevitably led to me feeling, once again, like a terrible person for not being able to just accept the truth I was taught like everyone else could.
I was a really brave kid, but I'm a really scared adult. The groups I was in taught me to be afraid of differences, to follow faith and belief over all else, to distrust and fear all secular groups and organizations, to assume everyone not in our groups was probably at LEAST unintentionally acting under the influence of Satan and his devils, and that I was surrounded by constant spiritual warfare that interfered in human affairs. I ended up scared of EVERYBODY except my own group and family. And then once I started to realize that they didn't seem to line up with reality, actually, I had the horrible realization that everything about the way they saw the world was a lie, actually, and all the people I'd been promised I could trust were untrustworthy. The world wasn't what they said, and I had to suddenly start learning how to trust "secular" people and the "secular" world and find out what else I didn't understand about history, science, etc.
I had to completely relearn how to evaluate people for safety and honesty, how events went down in history, what science actually shows about certain things, and how healthy human groups actually give, take, and interact. I'm still in the middle of all the relearning, honestly. I'm trying to figure out how to trust anyone after finding out how many people I trusted weren't safe or sources of truth after all.
I feel like I'm going to spend the whole rest of my life relearning how to be less afraid. But I'm glad I'm getting the chance to learn at all!

7) What effect did it have on your social behaviour ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I changed a lot of my behavior because of what the homeschool co-op and our Opus Dei group taught me when I was in middle and high school.
My mom started enforcing all their strict clothing and modesty rules, so clothes became a big problem for years. Even when I did try, I obviously never quite fit in with the other girls on my sports teams who had normal trending clothes that fit better. The other girls could tell I was different, between the clothes and the different modesty rules I had to follow in locker rooms and showers. It put some wedges between us that I never knew how to tear down as a kid.
These groups also led me to not interact with boys or men outside my family and extended family or close friends for a lot of years, because I was taught they were inherently dangerous and prone to lust and temptation. I ended up afraid of my own family members, too, because I figured there was always a chance that one of them might have fallen away from the faith and were secretly giving into temptations and I might not know until it was too late. This kind of thinking made it virtually impossible for me to fully trust anyone for years. I still don't know if the trust I have for people counts. I'm still figuring that out.
Between the ways I had to behave differently and the fear of non-insiders that I picked up, I feel like these two groups did a lot of damage to me in the social development department. I only started learning about real friend groups and about it being safe to have friends of different genders once I was in college.
I'm working on trying to isolate myself less. I hope someday I'll be less of cult me and more of four-year-old-me who invited every stranger in the grocery store to my birthday without hesitation. I much preferred that me, and I'm glad my time following the group rules didn't take away those memories lol. Someday I'll make it back to being that me.

8) What effect did it have on your physical condition (if any) ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was really, really run down while I was a part of Opus Dei events. Our schedules were packed, and we weren't really allowed time to think or chill by ourselves or have down time. We were busy from wakeup to passout. I usually left the Weekends of Recollection more tired than I started them! But the biggest impact the groups had is actually on my posture and muscles. The talks we got about modesty, purity, and looking out for our brothers in Christ, combined with the strict enforcement of the clothing and body-movement-checking rules the groups had, led me to end up scared that event just sitting or standing still might make men around me in church lust, or someone somewhere else attack me, and so I needed to minimize it. It helped to already have pretty loose clothing because of the rules, but I couldn't help the fact that my body was growing into more adult proportions, and so I decided the only thing I could do was try to minimize that, too. I trained myself to stand and breathe and walk in ways that minimized my curves and made me look as short, small, and flat as I could manage, and I tried to make sure that as little would tempt anyone around me as possible. Engraining those posture and movement patterns worked for a while, but years down the road it turns out that it's actually put a lot of strain on most of my body, and some of my joints are reaching their limits. So I've had to do some physical therapy and mental health therapy to deal with the patterns and pain of that, and undo what I taught myself when I tried to keep myself safe.
I also learned the concept of self-mortification as a punishment for sin from the Opus Dei group, but to be fair, they didn't teach us, I learned through the grapevine from some older girls who weren't supposed to know about the sleeping on boards/whipping/cilice chain on the thigh sometimes. That's just for numerary members of Opus Dei, and I think the rules for that stuff have changed over the years, too. So that part didn't impact me much, luckily.

9) How did the cult/high control group develop while you were inside ? (if it did)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both of the groups stayed pretty much the same while I was within them. I was too far down the ladder rungs to hear much, anyway. The updates I got usually came from my mom if she felt like discussing a meeting or a newsletter email. Both groups were already pretty fairly established in our local area while I was in them.

10) What were the interactions like inside the cult/high control group with the different members ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the other kids and teenagers like me, it was like interacting with other normal religious teenagers. We mostly were focused on being friends and having fun while doing whatever was required of us to get to the having fun part. Sometimes when the stakes were low we'd occasionally push each other to test boundaries of some of the group rules, but we mostly stayed in our lanes. Most of us were just happy to have some consistent friends.
With the parents in the homeschool co-op and the assistants and supernumeraries and non-member "cooperators" in Opus Dei, it was pretty basic--they were adults, we were not adults, we had to listen to them, and they would make things reasonably enjoyable for us so long as we behaved ourselves and showed we appreciated it and were respectful and stuff. They didn't have the final authority over us, but we were supposed to listen to them for the most part.
The Opus Dei numeraries, the camp directors, and the principle (or later, the rotating band of appointed homeschool moms) who ruled the homeschool co-op had to be obeyed flat-out. They didn't have peer conversations with us, although a few times I got a one-on-one talk from an Opus Dei numeraries about vocations. These people were the end of the line, and everyone listened to them. And in Opus Dei, the numeraries further listened to the leader of their prelature, who governs the whole of Opus Dei around the globe. His word is ultimate law in the group, along with the traditional teachings from Saint Josemaria.

11) How did you realize you were in a high control group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The short answer is: a couple friends used the word jokingly a few too many times about my life, and I ended up Googling it a little too hard.
The medium answer: Documentaries talking to or made by ex-cult-members made me realize way too many of their experiences and feelings sounded familiar.
The long, and slightly-embarassing answer: I briefly looked up the definition of "cults" when my friends joked about it, and then put it out of my mind. And then a year or two later when I was months into therapy sessions and in the middle of writing a fiction story where a child has been raised in a militant cult group, I started researching cults and the experiences of children raised in them so I could do the character and story justice.
I ended up going through a several-months-long crisis because I wrote too much fanfiction about Batman's kids and figured out through my research that what I'd been in counted as a high control group or cult. The rest is history.

12) What advice would you give someone in a similar situation as the one you were in ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main thing I'd say is that there's never going to be a good time to leave, and that everyone before you has had to do it scared and you will too, and that's okay. If you want to leave, you should. You should never, ever stay in a group just because you feel so pressured to or like it's dangerous to leave. No group like that is healthy. You're not wrong or bad for wanting to leave.
There's a lot more help in the world--and good people in the world--than you know about yet, and it's worth it to get out. Ask people who might be safe if they can help you. Look for resources if you can. Practice learning to listent to and trust your own conscience and your own instincts again in whatever ways you can, and that practice will add up in time. You're gonna feel like you're crazy, or you're going crazy, and you're not. But it's normal to feel that way.
Don't stop asking for help. Don't give up on yourself. It's okay to not be ready, but when you are, if you want to leave, leap. There are a lot of people who want to help catch you if you reach out. You're not alone, and there are a lot more people like you than you know.
There are websites and groups you can find for resources, too. Reach out. Whether it's a religious group, or a friend group, or a political group, or anything else, if you're in a high control group and want out, you deserve to get out. I'm proud of you and I hope you get to build a life you're proud to live. I'm rooting for you and I hope we all make it!
