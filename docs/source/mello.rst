Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : The bot is now recording.

[M] : That voice is metal as fuck.

[J] : What?

[M] : Oh my god.

[J] : So.

[M] : Okay.

[J] :  Do you want to introduce yourself? You can use whatever name, it’s okay.

[M] : Hi. I'm Mello. Mello. I like... I don't know what to say. Hi. I'm Mello. I got got by more than one cult at this point in time. We are going to be talking about only one. But I would like it to be known for the record that I have been gotten in two.

[J] : Awesome. Okay.

[M] : I just like it to be known.

[J] : Okay. So.

[M] : We're going to be talking about...

[J] : What?

[M] : I said... We are going to be talking about the second one, not the first.

[J] : The one I know about?

[M] : The cult of personality.

[J] : Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So. In...

1) What did you take part in ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : What did you take part in?

[M] : So. The cult didn't...

[J] : I'm just reading out the questions.

[M] : Oh no. I was answering the question. So. The cult didn't really have a name. Uhm, it was just like a very tight-knit group of people surrounding one quote-unquote deity. Literally just some guy. Uhm, But… Uhm, I guess it was like the server name because it was all over Discord was called Parapoppies. So I'm talking with other people that are like not in that… Uhm… cult of personality anymore. That's what we call it. That's what we call it is Parapoppies, but it never really had a name.

[J] : All right. Yeah.

2) What are their belief system ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : What are their belief system? And how does it articulate around the guru?

[M] : I don't know what guru means.

[J] : Like the one guy.

[M] : Oh. Okay. So a lot of the beliefs were centered around Uhm... It was... So do you know what a paraphilia is?

[J] : I do, but I'm going to assume that my teacher doesn't.

[M] : Okay. So a paraphilia is, Uhm… a sexual desire, I guess. Or like... I guess it's really like a malfunction in your brain, if I'm being honest. Uhm… But it can also cause you to be a necrophile or a zoophile or a pedophile. Uhm… Its, it's like a neurological thing. I guess. Or I don't know if it's actually neurological, but you know what I mean. It was centered around the idea that having, having those kind of illegal kinks were some kind of enlightenment. Uhm… Some sort of like... If you are into these things, you are the best of the best of my followers, was kind of the belief system. And we believed that Uhm… the main guy was some kind of deity or god Uhm, around sexual pleasure, was the concept. Uhm, It's important to mention that the person was in their late 20s and we were all under the age of 18. Uhm… And a lot of us did not have those paraphilias and we lied and said we did or developed them. Because of him.

[J] : Yes.

[M] : Uhm, because we wanted to fit in. Because we were nervous that, uhm,  he would be disappointed in us if we did not.

[J] : Alright.

3) Do you know how it was created ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : And do you know how it was created?

[M] : Yes. So... The main group, Parapoppies... The server was originally about like problematic writing. Like writing things like rape or like incest. Those kind of stories. A lot of us wrote that kind of thing. Or read that kind of thing to cope with actual trauma or sexual assault that happened to us in person. Like in real life, in our childhoods. So a lot of us wrote or read stories like that to cope with that. And the creator of the server created a server. around that um sort of to share writing and stuff like that um they let this this uh late 20 year old join and he sort of started it. I wasn't the first um kid that he had sexual relations with, but i was the first um in the server that he did um he came to my dns and i have issues with psychosis um he convinced me that i was some kind of god or goddess i guess that had fallen to earth and ended up in this body and i had just gotten out of the psych ward so i was very impressionable um and like open to suggestion i guess i would say and he um started praying on me because of that and he took advantage of that and convinced me i was some kind of goddess um and that he was god like he was a god and he um prayed on other kids in the servers after me um and convinced them of that as well and that's sort of how it like started started was because he was just like feeding into slowly but surely people's um issues with delusions and stuff like that because most of us had um different mental disorders that could cause those symptoms all right thank you so much um and you think you uh no sorry uh and how did you like first get in touch i think that was yeah yes so how did you first hebben an ent wires gottkup volunteering i think i joined it then that's way back when i joined it i joined it because i was in a different server for problematic writing and that server got taken down because because turned out the owner was sending people child porn

[J] : jesus christ that's awful

[M] : someone that wasn't that didn't not be contradicting the issue when it was someone that wasn't, that didn't, not the owner of the server, but someone on that server invited me to the other server and was like, hey, that's wild, isn't it? That that happened. Anyways, we have this other server that is not run by a pedophile. Do you want to join? And I said yes, so I joined. I think that a main reason that I ended up in this situation that I did was because there's such a stigma online kind of stuff, even if it's to vent out your personal trauma, that there's not a lot of safe places on the internet to talk about that kind of stuff, which in retrospect is probably a good thing, but at the time it made me feel really isolated from everyone, even my friends, my real life friends and my online friends, because it was something that like... I did in my spare time that I couldn't talk to anyone about, so I was like, yeah, sure, I'll join this server after the other one got taken down. But yeah.

[J] : Yeah, all right. Yeah, that does make sense.

4) Would you have been more wary of it if it hadn’t been online ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : Do you think you would have been more wary of it if it hadn't been online?

[M] : Definitely, yeah. I feel like, okay, I think like if... Instead of it being like a Discord server, I was invited to and instead it was like, oh yeah, so I go to this church and we all talk about like rape and stuff all of the time. I would have been like, you what?

[J] : Yeah.

[M] : What?

[J] : Yeah, that would make sense.

[M] : I definitely would have been a lot more concerned. Whereas a Discord server... It was like, I mean, nothing's going to happen, I say, not knowing. It's the fucking did-he-know gif.

[J] :  Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

5) What were the consequences of you being in that space ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : And what were the consequences of it, like of you being in that space?

[M] : I...  Okay, so...

[J] : If that's something you want to skip, we can just skip it.

[M] : Sorry. No, I'm trying to articulate. Well, first off... I have to have a lot of very uncomfortable conversations with police because we're getting police involved about the guy that was kind of running the group. Not the person that owned the server. That's a very important distinction. The person that owned the server was only 13. Like, they did not know what was happening.

[J] : Yeah.

[M] : And they were not... Yeah, they were a child. They were not sure enough to understand what was happening. I do not blame them for that at all. But, um... They were like... The person, like, the god, whatever. He, um... We're currently opening an investigation with the police about him because he has admitted over text to having sex with a 14-year-old before when he was, I think, like, 24. Um... So, we're getting police involved with him and his partner. Who was also one of the cult, like, I guess, managers. Like, we weren't told they were, like, a goddess. Or whatever. But they kind of, like, managed everything. And, like…

[J] : Mm-hmm.

[M] : Checked in with everyone to make sure they were still, like, with it. You know? But... Yeah, that... Yeah. But I guess that's kind of the con... There's not a whole lot of, like... It's not a whole lot of, like, oh, I'm, like, getting in trouble because of it. It's just uncomfortable conversations I have to have with, like, police and stuff.

[J] : Yeah. Because they have to get involved and that means a lot of testimonies and all that, I suppose.

[M] : Yeah, it's a lot.

[J] : Yeah.

5) What effects did it have on your social behaviour and social condition, if any ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : The next question was, what effect did it have on your social behavior? And what effects did it have on your physical condition, if any?

[M] : So, my social behavior effects that I'm still dealing with is, like, I don't know.  I'm very scared to talk to adults in general.

[J] :  Mm-hmm.

[M] : Despite being an adult. Like, anybody… Even people my age, because they're adults, I'm really nervous to talk to them when it comes to, like, online spaces. It, like, really scares me. and I think that's a really bad effect it's had on my social behavior. Physical condition... There was kind of, like… I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't say it was, like, a ritual, but it was kind of a thing to carve the gods' initials onto our bodies in places that were easy to hide from our parents to, like, quote-unquote, show devotion or whatever. I think you just, like, jerked off through it, but, you know. It was, like, a whole thing.

[J] : Mm-hmm.

[M] : So, when it comes to physical condition, I still have scars from that, which sucks because I'm not there anymore. I don't want that on my body, but it's going to be there probably for another couple years because it was kind of deep. But I would say that's pretty much the only thing it had on my physical condition.

[J] : Okay. Awesome.

6) How did it develop while you were inside of it, if it did ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : Thank you. How did it develop while you were inside of it, if it did?

[M] : So, because I was kind of the, like, catalyst for this cult of personality developing, I kind of watched most of the growth in the server. When I left, which is a whole different question, like, a whole different topic, I watched it develop from the outside, and it was, like, terrifying. Because me leaving caused them to not let any new members in, but it also caused a lot of things to get a lot stricter

[J] : Mm-hmm.

[M] : And a lot, like, more insulated, and it just got worse for the people that were still there in that group.

[J] : So, yeah. Watching it was a whole thing.

[M] : It was, yeah. It was crazy. It was, it was insane.

7) How did the fact that it was online impact it all ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : And how did the fact that it was online impact it all ? Like, things that would have been different ?

[M] : I think that with it being online, it was a lot easier for all of us to, like, hide it from our parents. Like, a lot of us still went to church during this, because a lot of us had Christian families and stuff like that. And with it being online, it's a lot easier to hide it, and it's a lot easier to not realize how fucking crazy the things you're doing are. Like, if

[J] : Mm-hmm.

[M] : If it was in person, and they came up to me, and they were like, hey, it would be super awesome and show that you're super cool, if you had sex with your dog. Like, in person, I would be like, what the fuck are you talking about? But online, it's a bit easier to, like, kind of, like, drop those, like… Like, like, steadily drop hints until it's time for them to want you to do the thing, and then,

[J] : Yeah

[M] : like, convince you to do it over text or over, like, a video call.

[J] : It just makes it easier for them to manipulate you.

[M] : Yeah

[J] : Because you're one step removed, so you think that it's, like, you think you're,
 you're more protected because you're one step removed?

[M] : Yeah, and also, like, it's sort of the.. the whole thing of, like, most of us came from very religious families, so when it all was going on, we were like… Oh, this is liberating. We're not in our, like, oppressive Christianity, let's say, like, like that stuff. We don't have to do that anymore. And, like… Oh, this is so much better. And also, it's online with gay people, so, like, we feel safer, you know?

[J] : Yeah. Yeah.

[M] : Because it was so removed from my, like, real life that I felt a lot more free to do things that I would not be free to do. You know what I mean?

[J] :  Yeah. Yeah.

[M] : It's a layer removed from your real life, so it makes it easier. It makes it easier to do everything.

[J] : Yeah.

8) What was the interactions like with the different members ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : Next question. What was the interactions like with the different members? Like, was there something like social status, hierarchy, all that?

[M] : I definitely was on the higher, like, part of, I guess, like, the social status stuff. I interacted with a lot of people, I had a lot of people wanting to, like, have, like, sex on call with me and stuff like that because [SC], like, suggested it and stuff like that.

[J] : Mm-hmm.

[M] : I was not close with the owner of the server, but I did talk to them quite frequently. And it was a lot of, like, [SC] wanted us to be, like, sharing porn and stuff like that.

[J] : Mm-hmm.

[M] : And interactions, like, there was a lot of, it was kind of, like, a big, like, evil polycule, I guess.

[J] : You reminded me of something.

[M] : He wanted us to all, like, be into each other like that because, one, it would make things for him easier. And, two, he found it hot, I guess.

[J] : Yeah.

[M] : Um, people talked to me a lot because he decided that I was, like, some kind of goddess. Um, which definitely fucked with my head really bad. But it also meant that a lot of people, like, responded to everything I said, so it really felt like I had friends. Um, and the, the quote-unquote manager that I've mentioned, um.

[J]  : Yeah?

[M] : They talked to me quite a lot to make sure I was still, like, in it. You know what I mean? J: Yeah. They, they check on you to make sure that you weren't, uh, thinking about leaving, all thatn?

[M] : Yeah. But, like, besides what was going on with me, with people acting like I was some kind of goddess and stuff like that, um, it was pretty much just everybody was below the main him. And he decided who was in and who was out. And he decided who he liked that day and stuff like that. And so there wasn't a lot of solidarity between us because we all kind of just wanted his, um, attention. But, kind of, it was, it was a lot of, like, trying to one-up each other, so we'd get a response from him. Um. Like, someone would be like, “oh, I found this, like,” – this is an actual example that happened – someone would be like, “oh, I found this interesting, um, serial killer, like, case”. And then someone would be like, “man, I wish I could be doing, I, I wish that happened to me.” Or, like, stuff like that because there was a lot of people that, um, got manipulated into thinking necrophilia was cool. Um. Uh. Hot take, guys. I don't think it is. Um. Hot take.

[J] : Hot take.

[M] : Hot take, guys. I don't think it's that cool. But, um, it was, it was like, “oh, yeah, I wish that would happen to me”. And then another person would respond and be like, in detail, like, “man, I wish this happened to me from that guy”. And then another person would be like, “man, I could imagine [SC] doing that to me. Holy shit”. And then, um, or, like, someone responding and being like, “I had a dream where something like that happened to me, and it was [SC] doing it”. And, like, try, trying to one-up each other to get attention was a very big thing.

9) Do you think it was on purpose to keep you from bonding together ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : Uh, do you think it was absolutely on purpose to keep you apart from each other and keep you from, like, bonding together?

[M]  : Definitely, because when I got, like, kicked out, um, there was, like, no solidarity.

[J] : Yeah.

[M] : It was just, I was gone. And no one checked up on me. No one questioned it at all. It was instantly, people just, like, turned on me. And, like, um, a lot of people lied and were like, oh yeah, well, when they were, when they were in the server they actually messaged me these horrible things about this other person. And then I looked back in our DMs and I was like, I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know. I've never talked to them in my life, I've never personally, yeah. So a lot of a lot of stuff like that. I definitely think that he didn't want us to, to be friends, he just wanted us to have sex with each other.

10) Did you realize how messed up it was while inside, or was it something you realized later ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : Yeah okay um and like while you were in it did you realize how messed up it was or was it something you realized once you were out of it?

[M] : Once I had the realization that I couldn't agree with what people were saying there I was kind of out, like, like, I was gone, yeah. Um. Not that I left it! I didn't leave like I got kicked out, um. I, I like begged to be let back in, like, it was, it was a really, um, bad time, um, but, like some of the things I noticed were like people talking about like real life serial killers and finding them hot. Um, yeah, and I, I, when I was in the cult I would look at that and I would be like, “I don't know if I find the actual serial killer hot. Maybe, like, the idea of being murdered like that, I guess, but like, I can't, I can't really fuck with that”. Or like um there was an entire channel about zoophilia and I just had it muted because I was like, “I find that kind of gross”. But it wasn't the realization that the whole thing was messed up it was just parts of it that I was like, “well I guess, like, that makes me feel really gross so I guess it's just not for me”, not like –

[J] : Yeah, just block and move on.

[M] : Do your thing, yeah.

11) How did you get out of the cult ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : Um okay almost done. Um so how did you get out? Like, you mentioned you were kicked out, how did that happen?

[M] : Um so what happened was, I was, um we were talking in chat – like in a discord text chat – and the owner of the server had gotten a hate comment on one of their zoophilia related stories that they posted online, and I mentioned, “yeah, I don't know, I mean, I think that it's like, I don't know, I don't know, it's really like, I understand why other people wouldn't want to see that content, even though, like I also understand why you would want to post it. But I don't, like, I just think that as long as it's tagged properly, I don't understand why people are arguing about it”. And everyone – not everyone – but suddenly, up, suddenly [SC] was like “What do you mean it's understandable that other people don't want to see it?” and I was like, “Oh well you know, like, zoophilia can like, upset other people, and I understand that, so like, I understand why people don't want to see it posted”. And suddenly everyone was so upset with me, um, and yelling at me and telling me that I was a horrible person and saying that I hated everybody with like, um, the zoo, like, paraphilia and like mental problems with that and stuff like that, and they were like you're a horrible person and you judge everybody in the server, that has it – which wasn't true. Um, and, um, I kind of – I got a breakup text from [SC], um and he was, like, “I can't do this anymore I know you hate my guts, um, I, you're making me like suicidal” was– he
claimed, and, um, “I messaged the owner of the server because I can't talk to you anymore”. And uh because I was, I was thoroughly in the sauce, I, um, freaked out, and I almost killed myself and it was horrible. Um. I got kicked out of the server, I have very shameful messages where I begged the owner to let me back in and I begged them to tell the main guy how sorry I was and that I was, like, sorry for being such a horrible person and I was willing to be fixed. Um. And they just didn't let me back in. Um. And it was, it was like, two weeks of, of, of me begging to be let back in because it was such like, a major part of my life. Um, yeah, thankfully it did not happen and instead all of the members just decided they hated me, and sent me death threats and told me to kill myself. Um, almost did, I'm gonna be so honest with you, I did try to kill myself, did not work, um, but it was, it was horrible. It was, it was probably, um, I would say the worst experience I've ever had online. Um. Can't say it's the worst experience I've ever had in general but you know why that is, so.

[J] : I do, I do, I do.

[M] : And I can't say it's the worst experience I've ever had in general–

[J] : But I think that's outside of the context of this interview. Um. Almost, almost done.

[M] : I won't make the jokes, I won't.

[J] : No, we don't have time to unpack all that.

12) Did the fact that the cult was online make it easier/harder for you to leave ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J]  : Um, how did the fact that it was online make it easier slash harder for you to leave ?

[M] : Um, it was definitely easier because I just got, like, straight up cut off and kicked out and by everyone. Um, it was, it was hard to rationalize like, okay, I, this group of people sucked and everything they were doing sucked and I hated it. You know what I mean, it was, it was really hard to rationalize that especially because I had never, I had never looked into cults that were like this or, like, I guess cults of personality. I've never, I'd never thought about it hard enough to realize that that was what was going on and how to cope with it, so I did very unhealthy things, um, because I was just cut off, like, cold turkey and it really fucked with my head.

13) What advice would you give to someone that’s in the situation you were in ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[J] : What advice would you generally give anyone that's in the situation that you were in if you had advice to give?

[M] : If, okay, if somebody is in a situation that they think is similar to what happened to me and they are still actively in it I would just suggest to like question everything you're taught maybe talk to people outside of that group if you can and be like “hey uh is this insane?”. Um I understand that hearing conflicting information that isn't like that that doesn't align with what you're being taught is going to make you instantly not want to listen to that person but just have an open mind and listen to every perspective not just the perspective of the people in your group um whether it be a group like like just
a discord server or a group that's a bit bigger like a whole religion, just be willing to listen to outside perspectives even if you don't think that your group is necessarily a cult there still might be manipulative things happening in that group and if you if you care about yourself and the other people there you should look into it.
